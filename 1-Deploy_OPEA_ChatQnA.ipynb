    "OPEA uses microservices to create high-quality GenAI applications for enterprises, simplifying the scaling and deployment process for production. These microservices leverage a service composer that assembles them into a megaservice thereby creating real-world enterprise AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to familiarize yourself with the MAIN key elements of OPEA:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [**GenAIComps**](https://github.com/opea-project/GenAIComps) \n",
    "A collection of microservice components that form a service-based toolkit. Each microservice is designed to perform a specific function or task within the GenAI application architecture. By breaking down the system into these smaller, self-contained services, microservices promote modularity, flexibility, and scalability. This modular approach allows developers to independently develop, deploy, and scale individual components of the application, making it easier to maintain and evolve over time. All of the microservices are containerized, allowing cloud native deployment. Here, you will find contributions to multiple partners/communities to further construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [**GenAIExamples**](https://github.com/opea-project/GenAIExamples)\n",
    "While *GenAIComps* offers a range of microservices, *GenAIExamples* provides practical, deployable solutions to help users implement these services effectively. This repo provides use-case-based applications that demonstrate how the OPEA architecture can be leveraged to build and deploy real-world GenAI applications. In the repo, developers can find practical resources such as Docker Compose files and Kubernetes Helm charts, which help streamline the deployment and scaling of these applications. These resources allow users to quickly set up and run the examples in local or cloud environments, ensuring a seamless experience."
