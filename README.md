# üöÄ OPEA Developer Training Courses

Welcome to the OPEA Developer Training Courses repository! This repository contains training materials and resources for OPEA (Open Platform for Enterprise AI) development, including documentation, examples, and learning paths for most of the blueprints implementations.

## üìù Overview

This repository is organized into two main folders:

- **`Curriculas/`**  
  Structured learning modules including:
  - üê≥ [Docker](Curriculas/Docker) & ‚ò∏Ô∏è [Kubernetes](Curriculas/Kubernetes/) fundamentals
  - GenAI application development
  - Best practices and deployment patterns

- **`Events/`**  
  Reference implementations from past workshops and demos:
  - Event-specific setups and configurations
  - Hands-on labs and demo environments
  - Custom deployment examples

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The content in `Events/` is intended for participants of specific workshops. These configurations are not guaranteed to work outside those environments and should be used for reference only.

| Event | Workshop Description |
|-------|----------------------|
| [AAAI 2025](/Events/AAAI-Workshop2025) | Streamlining Enterprise AI RAG Pipelines with OPEA and IBM DataPrepKit |
| [MS Build 2025](/Events/Microsoft-Build-Workshop2025) | Streamlining Enterprise AI RAG Pipelines with OPEA ChatQnA |
| [ODSC](/Events/GenAI-Workshops) | Deploying OPEA ChatQnA RAG on Kubernetes |

## üìö Learning Resources

Explore structured learning content and hands-on blueprints to deepen your understanding of OPEA project.

All curricula in the `Curriculas/` folder are delivered as **Jupyter Notebooks** to make learning interactive and easy to follow. These notebooks walk you through each concept with explanations, code examples, and exercises‚Äîideal for self-paced training and experimentation.
